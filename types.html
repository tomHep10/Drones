<p id="multirotor">
    Multirotor Drones: These drones, equipped with multiple rotors,
    offer exceptional stability and are popular for photography, mapping,
     and inspections. They typically have shorter flight times due to
     energy-intensive hovering. Learn more about multirotor capabilities
    and uses at <a href="https://www.grepow.com/blog/multirotor-vs-fixed-wing-vs-vtol-uav-what-is-the-difference.html">Grepow</a>
</p>

<p id="Fixed-Wing">
    Fixed-Wing Drones: Known for their aerodynamics and efficiency,
    fixed-wing drones can cover large distances at high speeds,
    making them ideal for surveying and environmental monitoring.
    However, they need space for takeoff and landing.
    You can find more about their advantages at
    <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/fixed-wing-drone">sciencedirect</a>
</p>

<p id="single-rotor">
    Single-Rotor Drones: Featuring one main rotor and a tail rotor,
    these drones are structurally similar to helicopters and are suitable
    for longer flights and carrying heavier loads. Their design makes them
    more efficient than multirotors. Discover more at
    <a href="https://www.dronetutorials.com/single-rotor-drones">Drone Tutorials</a>.
</p>


<p id="hybrid-vtol">
    Fixed-Wing Hybrid VTOL Drones: These drones combine fixed-wing and
     multirotor capabilities, allowing for vertical takeoff and landing
     along with extended flight distances. They're especially useful in
     difficult terrain where traditional takeoff isn't possible. Read more

<p id="tactical-military">
    Tactical Military Drones: Designed for reconnaissance, surveillance, and
    combat, these drones are highly specialized, capable of enduring challenging
    conditions and performing various military missions. Learn more at
    <a href="https://www.militarydrones.com/tactical">Military Drones</a>.
</p>

<p id="micro-nano">
    Micro and Nano Drones: These miniature drones are ideal for indoor
    inspections, surveillance, and exploration in confined spaces. Despite
    their small size, they're packed with sophisticated technology. Find
    additional information at
    <a href="https://www.micronanodrones.com">Micro and Nano Drones</a>.
</p>

<p id="racing">
    Racing Drones: Built for speed and agility, racing drones are used in
    competitive events where pilots navigate complex courses at high speeds.
    These drones are often customized for maximum performance. Read more at
